Graphics processing units (GPUs) are well-designed for high-performance
computing.
Programming frameworks are also getting matured for general-purpose
computing on GPUs (GPGPU).
Originally, runtime environments of GPU computing are tailored to
accelerate particular best-effort applications.
In recent years, however, GPU computing has been applied for real-time
applications, improving resource management mechanisms of the operating
system (OS) kernel.
Unfortunately, such a system extension is often a complex undertaking
for research and development, and the modifications to kernel source
code often narrow down consistency of OS kernel and device driver.
In this paper, we present Linux-RTXG, which is a loadable kernel module
approach to coordinated CPU and GPU resource management.
Linux-RTXG does not require the OS kernel to be modified at the source
code level, instead adding resource management mechanisms by loadable
kernel modules with user-space library support.
To achieve coordinated CPU and GPU resource management in Linux-RTXG,
such as real-time scheduling and resource reservation, we design and
implement novel interrupt intercept mechanisms and independent interrupt
mechanisms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the presented system achieves
real-time scheduling and resource reservation capabilities for
GPU-accelerated systems, maintaining the system overhead comparable to
existing kernel-dependent approaches.
