Graphics processing units (GPUs) easily provide the benefits of high-performance computing.
However, GPUs runtime environment is target to best-effort oriented application, and do not consider real-time.
Previous work have contributed for real-time GPU, and depends kernel.
Dependence on the kernel and the device driver gives the burden developers and users.
We present Linux-RTXG which is realized CPU-GPU real-time extending framework without kernel modification.
Linux-RTXG has a CPU real-time scheduler, a GPU real-time scheduler, and a GPU reservation mechanism.
To achieve framework without kernel modification, 
we presents interrupt intercept mechanisms and independent interrupt mechanisms and to solved currently linux kernel real-time scheduling problem.
Our experimental result,
we indicate overhead of GPU scheduling using Linux-RTXG framework,
and then, kernel free's approach performances of QoS management had kept equivalent performance as compared with the existing kernel-dependent approach.
