Graphics processing units (GPUs) easily provide the benefits of high-performance computing.
However, GPUs runtime environment is target to best-effort oriented application, these does not consider real-time.
Previous work have contributed for real-time GPU, these have depends kernel.
Dependence on the kernel and the device driver gives the burden developers and users.
We present Linux-RTXG which is realized cpu-gpu realtime extending framework while kernel free.
Linux-RTXG have a CPU real-time scheduler, a GPU real-time scheduler and a GPU reservation mechanisms.
To achieve kernel free framework, 
we presents interrupt intercept mechanisms and independent interrupt mechanisms and to solved currently linux kernel real-time scheduling problem.
Our experimental result,
we indicate overhead of GPU scheduling using Linux-RTXG framework,
and then, kernel free's approach performances of QoS management had kept equivalent performance as compared with the existing kernel-dependent approach.
