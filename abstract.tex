Graphics processing units (GPUs) are increasingly well-designed for
high-performance computing.
GPU programming environments have also become matured for
general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU).
Originally, the GPU software stack is tailored to accelerate
particular best-effort applications.
In recent years, however, GPU technologies have been applied for
real-time systems, extending the operating system (OS) modules to
support real-time GPU resource management.
Unfortunately, such a system extension makes it difficult to maintain
the system with version updates, since the OS kernel and device drivers
need to be modified at the source code level, preventing continuous
research and development of GPU technologies for real-time systems.
In this paper, we present a loadable kernel module (LKM) framework
called Linux-RTXG, which implements real-time GPU resource management in
Linux without making any modification to the OS kernel and device
drivers.
Linux-RTXG provides novel interrupt interception and independent
synchronization mechanisms to achieve real-time scheduling and resource
reservation capabilities for GPU applications on top of existing device
drivers and runtime libraries.
Experimental results demonstrate that the overhead of introducing
Linux-RTXG is comparable to existing kernel-dependent approaches, and
multiple GPU applications can be successfully scheduled by Linux-RTXG to
meet their priority and quality of service (QoS) requirements in
real-time.
