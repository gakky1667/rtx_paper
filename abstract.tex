Graphics processing units (GPUs) facilitate high-performance computing.
However, GPU runtime environments target to best-effort oriented applications, and do not consider real-time applications.
Previous work have contributed to real-time GPU, depends on the kernel.
Dependence on the kernel and device driver gives incurs burden to developers and users.
We present Linux-RTXG, a method that uses a loadable kernel module approach without kernel modification to coordinate CPU and GPU resources for a real-time scheduling framework.
Linux-RTXG employs a CPU real-time scheduler, a GPU real-time scheduler, and GPU reservation mechanisms.
To achieve the proposed framework without kernel modification,
we present interrupt intercept mechanisms and independent interrupt mechanisms and to solved currently Linux kernel real-time scheduling problem.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed kernel modification free Linux-RTXG framework achieves, GPU scheduling overhead and quality of service management performance comparable to existing kernel-dependent approaches.
