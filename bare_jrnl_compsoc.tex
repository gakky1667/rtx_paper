% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 12pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   %\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
   \usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
\else
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{R}{eal-time} system は社会インフラにおいて重要な役割を担っている。
Real-time systemsはこれまでも、ロボットやマルチメディアシステム、工場システムなど社会に密接に関わるシステムとして、
役割を果たしてきた。
さらにこれからは、Cyber-physical systemという考え方が発達してきており、より社会を支えていくインフラとして役割を担っていくと考えている。
Cyber-Physial systems represent next generation networked and embedded systems.
These system was tightly coupled with computation and physical elements to control real-world phenomena.
There control algorithms are becoming more and more complex, which distinguishes CPS from traditional safety-critical embedded systems in terms of the computational cost.
From their factors, CPS requires more high-performance computing resources to achieve real-fast computing.

One solution for achieving real-fast computing is to use GPUs.
GPUs can be realized fast computing for data-intensive application by parallel computing wiht many-core processor.
GPUs application developing is become easier since vendor was official supported GPGPU framework that is include programming language and runtime.
So GPUs have been rapidly spread.

さらに驚くことにGPU技術は発展可能性が高い。
2013年に発表され、その性能から話題になったNVIDIAのGeforce GTX TITANの単精度浮動小数点演算性能は4.5TFLOPSであるが、2014年に発表されたGeforce GTX TITAN Zは8T Flopsの性能を持っている。この成長率は異常といっても過言ではない。
加えてGPUといえば大量のコアが搭載されていることから、直感的には電力消費が激しいと思われている。
しかしながら能力あたりの電力消費は従来のCPUに比べてかなり優れており、
CPSのニーズを絶妙に満たしているといえ、実際のアプリケーションでもGPUは利用されている。
例えばObject detection, pedestrian tracking, navigation and route plannning.

GPUで汎用計算することをGeneral Purpose GPU (GPGPU) と呼ぶ.
GPGPUは如何なる環境でも動作するということではなくいくつかの制限がある。
ハードウェアが搭載できるかという点は当然として、
ベンダーによってライブラリやデバイスドライバなどのランタイムが提供される環境のみで動作可能である。
現状ベンダーによってGPGPUがサポートされているのはWindows、Mac OSX、Linuxのみである。
LinuxのメインラインではSCHED\_DEADLINEやPREEMPT\_RTのような
リアルタイムなワークロードをサポートするための取り組みが行われている。
加えて、Linuxの変異体としてRTOSとして提供されているものも数多くあり、
リアルタイムに最も近いと言える。
そのため、本論文ではLinuxを用いる。

我々の知る限り、現段階で最も優れているであろうGPU資源管理に関する研究は、
GPUSync\cite{}とGdevであり、リアルタイムに関してはGPUSyncが一歩先んじている。
しかしながら、GPUSyncは$LITMUS^{RT}$上に実装されており、カーネルへの変更を多分に含んでいる。
Gdevについても、デバイスドライバのISRに変更を加えており、OSへのパッチをあてることでのインストレーションを必要としている。
このパッチを当てる作業は開発者とユーザへ大きな負担を与える。
開発者は、常に最新のカーネルのリリースに追い付くために、パッチを維持していく義務がある。
しかしLinuxはその更新頻度が早く、開発者が最新のカーネルにむけてポーティング作業を完了させる前に、新しいバージョンのリリースが起きることが多い。
そのためカーネルの選択について制限される傾向がある。


\textbf{Contribution:}
本論文では、GPUを保持するシステムにおいて、リアルタイムなワークロードをサポートするために、ユーザーレベルで可能なことをExploreする。
ここでのユーザーレベルとは、OSをいじらずにユーザができることという意である。

我々はこれまでに、カーネルにパッチを当てずに、ユーザレベルでRTOS拡張が実現可能なRESCH\cite{}を提案してきた。
RESCHはLinuxのローダブルカーネルモジュールを利用しており、カーネルの内部関数を利用してスケジューリングすることで、ユーザレベルでのスケジューリング拡張を実現している。

残念なことに、RESCHは一般的なCPUで構成されたシステムを想定として作られており、
GPUのようなコプロセッサを追加したヘテロジニアスな環境には対応できておらず、CPSの基盤として用いることができない。

しかしながらGPGPUランタイムはクローズドソースである。




本アプローチはGPUのアクセスの調停や、GPUカーネル終了時の同期のハンドリングを行い、GPUのスケジューリングを可能とした上で、RESCHのアプローチに載せてユーザレベルでGPUのスケジューリングをサポートする。
具体的には、

加えて、CPUのみのタスクとGPUが含まれるタスクが混在するシステムにおいて、
考えられるスケジューリングの仕方について考察し、それらを取捨選択できる基盤として提供していくことで、今後の研究発展につなげていく。

\textbf{Organization}
This paper rest of 
本論文は◯章で構成される。
次章では、対象とするシステムの説明。
3章では、先行研究を解説し、解決すべき点を列挙し、
4章においてそれらの点の解決について説明する。
5章では、Linux-RTXGを利用した際の各オーバヘッドについて計測し評価を行う。
6章で本Linux-RTXGの問題点と今後の展望について考察していく。


\section{GPU Scheduling Discussion}
今回ターゲットとするシステムは、
一個以上のCPUがあり、一個以上のGPUが搭載された、単一のノードである。
その上でCPUのみを使うタスク、GPUを使うタスクが混在し、それぞれ周期タスク、非周期タスクが存在することを想定する。

Gdevは我々が提案してきたオープンソースGPUフレームワークである。
リザベーションベースのBANDスケジューリングを行うことでアイソレーションを確保し、QoSの担保を行っている。BANDスケジューラは仮想GPUという形でリソースを分割しており、タスクはそれぞれの仮想GPUに所属してそのリソースを利用していく。仮想GPU内ではFixed-Priorityによってスケジュールされる階層的スケジューラの形をとっている。
GdevはスケジューリングをGPUへのアクセス開始から、同期するまでとしており、CPUの動作に一切関与していない。
Gdev's scheduling target is between the starting of GPU access and the synchronization.
It is not involved at all with the operation of CPU.

GPUSyncは、Elliot et al. が提案するリアルタイムGPUフレームワークである。
GPUSyncではGPUのスケジューリングではなく、GPUが含まれたタスクとしてスケジューリングを行っており、
評価では、Clustered-EDFを用いたことを示している。
GPUへのアクセスについてはBudget Enforcement方式

\subsection{GPU synchronization}
GPUのアプリケーションには共通する特性がある。
それはGPUに処理を発行してから、終了するまでの待機時間が発生することである。
待機中に同一タスクで処理を継続する例もあるが、その処理結果は同期しなければ受け取ることができないため、
必ず同期時間が発生する。
この同期時間はself-suspendingに関連する問題を発生させる。
加えて、その同期方法によってはレイテンシが大幅に増加するために、
適切な手法によって同期が行われなければならない。

GPUの同期は2つの手法がある。
一つはfenceを用いる方法。
もう一つは割込みを用いる方法である。
GPUには多くのエンジン（マイクロコントローラ）が搭載されている。
本論文では詳しいアーキテクチャは本題ではないので省略する。詳細は過去の文献\cite{timegraph,fucc}に記載しています。
このエンジンにはCOMPUTEやCOPY用のものがある。
これらのエンジンにはコマンドバッファに格納されたコマンドをFIFOで処理していく。
Fenceを用いた方式では、まず同期用に仮想アドレス空間にマップされたバッファをGPUメモリに用意する。
そして、このメモリに値をEngine経由で書き込む用にコマンドを発行する。
すると、カーネル実行とメモリ転送終了後にエンジンが値を書き込むため、
CPU側でそのマップされたメモリアドレスをポーリングしながらチェックすれば同期が可能である。
割込みを用いる方式についてもEngineの機能を利用する。
タスクはTASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE/TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLEにした上でschedule()を呼ぶか、
waitqueueなどを用いて上記に相当する処理を行いsuspendする。
そしてEngineから割込みを発生させるコマンドを発行し、割り込みコントローラがそれを獲得、
GPUドライバが登録したISRを立ち上げる。
ISR内では、各割込みに関するステータスをマッピングされたレジスタから読み込み、
各割込みごとに処理を行う。処理後は割込み完了フラグを書き込み、初期化する。

一般的な利用の場合、多くはfenceが用いられるが、
Gdevなどはスケジューリングにおいてあるタスク終了後、次のタスクを立ち上げる部分に割込みを用いている。
一般的にこれらはCPU側の実装の仕方によって異なる。
前者は待機するタスクの状態がTASK\_RUNNINGの時に、sched\_yield()などを用いて他のタスクへの影響を考慮しながらポーリングする場合に適している。
後者は待機するタスクの状態がTASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE/TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLEの時に、割込みというeventによってタスクを立ち上げて処理を継続していく。

Linux scheduler have various real-time scheduling policies that were SCHED\_DEADLINE, SCHED\_FIFO, SCHED\_RR.
We support all scheduling policies that was implemented by linux.
However, synchronization does not work well in a specific scheduling policy.
The problem that is synchronization by fence in the SCHED\_DEADLINE.
It problem is synchronization by fence under the SCHED\_DEADLINE.
It because, implementation of sched\_yield() cede cpu to other tasks, by to set the next deadline to current deadline and to set 0 to budget.

%LinuxのスケジューリングポリシーにはSCHED\_DEADLINE, SCHED\_FIFO, SCHED\_RR, SCHED\_NORMALなどが実装されている。
%Linux-RTXgではLinuxに既存で実装されているスケジューリングポリシー全てに対応する。
%しかし、スケジューリングポリシーによっては上記の割込みが正常に動作しないケースがある。
%それがSCHED\_DEADLINEにおいてはfenceによる同期ができない問題である。

その理由はSCHED\_DEADLINEでのsched\_yield()の実装がデッドラインを次の周期に設定しバジェットを0に設定することで優先度を低下させ、他のタスクにCPUを譲っているためである。
つまり、sched\_yield()を用いたポーリングではその周期内での実行を諦めるため、必ずデッドラインミスとなる。
しかしながら、sched\_yeild()を利用しない場合、同期待ちの間CPUを専有してしまう。
CPUの専有は非効率であり好ましくない。

そのためlinux-rtxgではSCHED\_DEADLINEのポリシーの際は割込みによってGPU処理との同期を行う。
つまり、タスクを一旦サスペンドする。
しかしサスペンド後、SCHED\_DEADLINEではスリープからの復帰時に以下式(1)を用いてスケジューリング可能性のシンプルな検証を行う。
{\scriptsize
\begin{equation}
\frac{Absolute\_Deadline - Current\_Time}{Remaining\_Runtime} > \frac{Relative\_Deadline}{Period}
\end{equation}
}
式(1)が真の時、バジェットが補充され、デッドラインが次の周期に設定される。
従って同期時に必ず自らサスペンドすることによってこの検証に引っかかり、デッドラインが更新されてしまう。
これはConstand Bandwidth Serverの仕様であり、self-suspensionを含んだタスクのスケジューリングを考慮していないためである。
このself-suspensionはスケジューリング可能性についても影響を与えており、リアルタイムマルチコアスケジューリングの困難な問題の一つである。
不幸なことだが我々の知る限り、このSelf-Suspensionはglobalリアルタイムアルゴリズムにおいて解決された例は無く、
我々もそれを完全に解決する手段は提供することができない。

我々はこの復帰時のチェックに関しては、スリープ中も順調にタスクが実行していると仮定して、スリープしている時間(=GPUの実行時間)をRemaining\_Runtimeから引くことで対応した。
システム設計者はこれを想定して、runtimeのパラメータにはCPU execution time + GPU execution time (included data transmission time)を含めて設定しなければならない制約があるため、最適ではない手法ではあるが、カーネルを操作しない手法としてはこれが最善ということで妥協した。

以上の、割込み方式での同期+復帰時のパラメータ調整によってSCHED\_DEADLINE下でのGPU実行を含むタスクをサポートした。
その他のスケジューリングポリシーではfenceによる同期でも問題は発生しないため、全スケジューリングポリシーをサポートできたといえる。

\subsection{Interrupt interception}
前述した割込みはデバイスドライバ（カーネルと共にパッケージされている）によって登録されたISRがハンドルする。
Linux-RTXではスケジューリング用のワーカースレッドを立ち上げており、次に実行するタスクの選択が終わってからそのタスクの実行が終わるまでは実行停止状態で待機する。
上記SCHED\_DEADLINE時のwait queueueを用いた場合に置いても、たすくの　実行が終わり同期されるまで実行停止状態で待機する。
これらを適切に立ち上げるためには任意の割込みを獲得し、外部ISRがその割込みがどのカーネルに関連しているかを識別できる仕組みが必要である。
加えて、割込みの識別はGPUのステータス・レジスタを読み込んで行う必要があり、GPUドライバが割込みレジスタをリセットする前に、実行される必要がある。

そのため我々は、GPUに関する割込みを傍受し、我々の割込みハンドラを先に呼び出し、オリジナルの割り込みハンドラへとシーケンシャルに移行するようにする。
Linuxの割込みは分割割込みを用いており、前半部分をtop-half、後半部分をbottom-halfと呼ぶ。

gllenらの提供するklmirqdはtaskletがリアルタイム性に及ぼす問題について言及し、bottom-halfに位置するtaskletをオーバライドしている。
この手法を我々の目的のために適用しようと考えた際、bottom-halfでは
我々の割込み傍受はtop-halfをオーバーライドする。



Linuxでは、割込み番号ごとにirq\_descという割込みのパラメータを保持する構造体を持っている。
この構造体には割り込みハンドラの関数ポインタを含むirq\_actionという構造体がリストで接続されている。
irq\_descはグローバルな領域に確保されており、カーネル空間からであれば誰でも参照可能である。
Linuxのローダブルカーネルモジュールはカーネル空間で動作しているため、このirq\_descを取得でき、
Interrupt handlerの関数ポインタも取得可能である。

我々はこの取得した関数ポインタを保持し、我々の傍受用割込みハンドラを設定、コールバック関数を保持している関数ポインタから設定することで、
GPUに関する割込みの発生後、先んじて取得が可能である。ただしこの手法は当然のことながら、割込みを遅延させることにほかならないため、オーバヘッドについて綿密な評価をSec\ref{sec:eval}にて示す。

\subsection{Independent interrupt}
我々のこれまでの実験から、NVIDIAのClosed-source software ではコンテキスト生成時の設定によってはカーネル実行後に割り込みを発生していることがわかった。
実際にinterrupt interceptionによって盗聴した結果が\ref{fig:interception_result}である。NVIDIAのドキュメントによると、CUDAはワーカースレッドを立ち上げて、
割込みを受け取り、同期を行っている。

しかしながらこの割込みは、我々のアプローチではどのカーネル実行に関連付けされているかが区別できなかった。
したがって、ひとつのGPUへの複数のアクセスを許可した場合、割込みを利用したスケジューリングが不可能になる。

そのためここでは、ランタイムから独立した割込み機構として、独自に割込みを発生させる仕組みを実装する。
NVIDIAのクローズドソースドライバはNouveauプロジェクトのリバースエンジニアリングによる解析によって、ioctlを使ったインタフェースになっていることがわかっている。
Gdevではこの解析された情報を用いて、NVIDIAのクローズドソースドライバとオープンソースライブラリという掛け合わせでCUDAを実行できる基盤が構築されている。
本論文では、この基盤から割込みを発生させる部位のみ抽出し、スケジューリングに用いる。

本手法は大きく2つに分かれ、それぞれInitializeとNotifyと呼ぶ。
Initializeは、いわゆるコンテキストの生成に値する。Virtual Address Spaceやコマンド送信に用いるIndirect Bufferの確保、コンテキストオブジェクトの生成などを行う。
NotifyはComputeエンジンやCopyエンジンに向けて割込み発生のコマンドを送信する。

本アプローチに用いるインタフェースは公式にサポートされていないために、ベンダーによる急な仕様変更には対応できない。
しかしながら、これ以外に割込みを発生させるアプローチがなく、クローズドソースを用いた場合の限界であるといえる。


\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Environment}
本論文では2台のマシンを用いて評価する。

1台目はIntel Core i7 2600 3.40GHzのCPUで、
4GB*2のメモリ、GPUはGeForce GTX680を用いる。
KernelはLinux kernel 3.16.0を用い、ディストリビューションはUbuntu 14.04である。
CUDAランタイムはcuda-6.0 or Gdev、GPUドライバはNVIDIAの331.62を用いる。

2台目はIntel Core i7 3770 3.40GHzのCPUで、
4GB*2のメモリ、GPUはGeForce GTX480を用いる。
KernelはLinux kernel 3.16.0を用い、ディストリビューションはUbuntu 14.04である。
CUDAランタイムはGdev、GPUドライバはNouveauを用いる。

基本的にはNVIDIAドライバがインストールされる1台目を用いるが、
Nouveauドライバを用いる必要性のある評価でのみ2台目を用いる。

より高精度な測定を行うために、ユーザ空間ではclock\_gettimeを用いて直接TSCレジスタにアクセスして測定する。
カーネル空間ではsched\_clock()を用いて計測する。

\subsection{Interrupt intercept overhead}
Interrupt interceptのオーバヘッドの測定を行う。
本評価では、GPUドライバはnouveauを用いる。
割り込み処理は、各割り込みの種類によって、処理時間が異なり、その分布は一様ではないため、単に測定して平均をとっても比較ができない。
そのため各割り込みの種類の判別のためにNouveauを用いて、割り込みの種類が同一のもので、カーネル内のdo\_IRQ関数内でハンドラが呼ばれてから終了までの時間を測定し
どの程度のオーバヘッドで割り込みの盗聴及び、盗聴した割り込みの識別ができるかどうかを測定する。

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{graph/interrupt.pdf}
\caption{Interrupt intercept overhead}
\end{center}
\label{fig:irq_overhead}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{irq_overhead}は上記設定で測定した結果である。
Raw ISRは通常のルーチンで実行されるISR、ISR Interceptは割り込みを盗聴するのみ、ISR intercept w/Funcは盗聴した上でその割り込みがどの割込みか識別しスケジューラを立ち上げる機能を実行した場合である。
それぞれ1000回の測定で平均値を取り、最小値と最大値についてエラーバーで示している。
この図から見て取れるように、オーバヘッドは確実に存在する。
ISR Interceptだと247nsのオーバヘッドであり、
ISR Intercept w/Funcでも790nsのオーバヘッドである。
この数値は直感的に考えると小さくシステム自体に影響を及ぼすほどではないと考えられる。
しかしその積み重ねによっては影響を与えることは考えなければならない。

\subsection{Interrupt raised overhead}
本稿では割込み立ち上げのためのオーバヘッドを測定する。
割込み立ち上げは2つのAPIの呼び出しを必要とする。
一つはcuCtxCreateを呼び出したあとに呼び出すrtx\_nvrm\_init()である。
もう一つは同期したいタイミング(e.g. カーネルラウンチ後)に呼び出すrtx\_nvrm\_notify()である。
スケジューリングを行わないVanillaな状態ではこれらのAPIは必要ではないものであるため、これらのAPIにかかった時間はすべてオーバヘッドとなる。

そのためこれらのオーバヘッドの計測を行う。
計測はAPIの呼び出しから戻るまでを測定する。

\begin{figure}[!t]
\begin{center}
\subfigure[Part of Initialize]{\includegraphics[width=0.23\textwidth]{graph/irq_rise_init.pdf}}\subfigure[Part of notify]{\includegraphics[width=0.23\textwidth]{graph/irq_rise_notify.pdf}}
\caption{Interrupt raised method overhead}
\label{fig:irq_rise_overhead}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

結果をFigure \ref{fig:irq_rise_overhead}に示す。
InitializeはIndirect Bufferはプロセスが立ち上がるたびに、
コマンド送信用のIndirect Bufferの確保や各エンジンの登録のために呼び出される必要がある。
Notifyはカーネル実行後や非同期メモリコピー実行後のような実際に割込みを発生させたいタイミングで呼び出される。
これらはioctlシステムコールによってユーザ空間とカーネル空間をまたいでる影響か、実行時間のバラ付きが大きく出ている。

Initializeは比較的時間がかかっているが、1プロセスにつき一度しか呼ばれないため、アプリケーション全体への影響は少ないと考えられる。
Notifyに関してはそれほど時間がかかっておらず、同期待ちの間に実行されるべき処理なため、こちらもアプリケーション全体への影響は少ないと考えられる。
