\SECTION{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper has presented Linux-RTXG, a Linux extention with the
LKM-based real-time GPU resource management module.
Linux-RTXG accomplished GPU resource management without modifying the OS
kernel and device drivers in addition to CPU resource management from
the previsou work~\cite{kato2009loadable, asberg2012exsched}.
We also developed new schemes for GPU resource management.
By intercepting the interrupts from the GPU in the top-half ISRs, the
developed synchronization mechanism can wait for completion of specific
GPU kernels, without the need of modifying the OS kernel and device
drivers.
The experiments indicated a unit of task overhead met within about
$10\%$ at eight tasks, while within about $4\%$ at four tasks. 
Furthermore, the prioritization and QoS performance of Linux-RTXG were
demonstrated with a real-world object detection application, where GPU
programs can be protected from high CPU load, while successfully
maintaining the desired frame rate on the GPU.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete work that
achieved GPU resource management with loadable kernel modules.
