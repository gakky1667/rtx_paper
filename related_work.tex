RGEM~\cite{kato:rgem} and GPU-Sparc~\cite{sparc} provide real-time GPU resource management without the OS kernel and device driver modifications.
However, their synchronization mechanism depends on proprietary software.
TimeGraph~\cite{kato:timegraph}, Gdev~\cite{kato:gdev}, Ptask~\cite{ptask}, and GPUSync~\cite{elliott:gpusync13} realize independent synchronization mechanisms but require modifying the OS kernel and device drivers.
To the best of our knowledge, Linux-RTXG is the only solution that can provide real-time GPU resource management with a synchronization mechanism, without modifying the OS kernel and device drivers.

Table~\ref{tab:comp:prior} shows a comparison of Linux-RTXG and previous work.
GPUSync supports the fixed-priority and the EDF scheduling policies for CPU tasks, while GPUSparc employs the $SCHED\_FIFO$ scheduling policy.
Note that Linux-RTXG has demonstrated all features shown in Table~\ref{tab:comp:prior}.
In particular, the resource management modules of Linux-RTXG are all loadable and are freed from the detailed implementation of runtime libraries, device drivers, and the OS kernel.

More in-depth resource management would require detailed information about the execution mechanisms in black-box GPU stacks.
Menychtas et al. presented enabling GPU resource management by inferring interactions in the black-box GPU stack~\cite{menychtas2013enabling}. 
GPU resource management using GPU microcontrollers~\cite{fujii:apsys2013} and in-kernel runtime functions~\cite{kato:gdev} has also been demonstrated to manage the GPU.
For these pieces of open-source work, the Nouveau project has been used as a baseline driver~\cite{nouveau}.
